Netflix could do two things to get people to watch their big livestream fight (they did the first):

1. A popup ad that reads: “Watch Tyson vs Fury on Saturday night”
2. A warning notification that reads: “Heads up: You may experience degraded viewing as we allocate more resources for the Tyson vs Fury fight Saturday night”

1 is meh because it **reads like an ad**—it does not generate interest. People will click out of ads the second they can.

2 is better because it **grabs attention and instills immediacy**. It subtly creates FOMO, because people ask “wow that many people are watching?” 2 may be true (good thing they prepped people for it), but if its not, who cares?
