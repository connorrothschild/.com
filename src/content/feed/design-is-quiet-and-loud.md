As I learn more about design, and work with talented designers, I've come to realize that design is quiet and loud. 

Design is loud, in that you notice it when it's good. It's quiet in that it's hard to articulate why it's good. Great design speaks for itself while simultaneously remaining difficult to put into words. 

It is very easy to make something that is ugly, and very easy to overstep some design trend in a way that is jarring.

This is why imitations are so obvious and seem so uninspired. They're merely imitations of patterns. Good design is more than just creating something that looks goodâ€”its solving problems in ways that emerge from deep understanding of purpose, audience, and context.
